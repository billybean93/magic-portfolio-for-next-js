## Overview

This set of models demonstrates valuation and investment-case development across listed and project-level contexts. The work emphasizes transparent assumptions, capital structure logic, and sensitivity-aware decision support.

## Objective

- Build credible valuation frameworks for investment discussion.
- Stress-test assumptions under multiple operating scenarios.
- Support recommendation quality with model-backed evidence.

## Data / Inputs

- FPT and FRT valuation spreadsheets.
- Investment summary report.
- Project studio model workbook.

## Methodology

- Historical statement structuring and forecast driver mapping.
- DCF and comparative valuation framing where applicable.
- Scenario and sensitivity testing for high-impact assumptions.
- Output interpretation for decision-ready recommendations.

## Key Findings

- Valuation conclusions are highly sensitive to growth persistence and margin normalization assumptions.
- Scenario ranges provide stronger decision utility than single-point valuation outputs.
- Model discipline (assumption traceability, checks, and structure) improves review speed with senior stakeholders.

## Business Impact

The modeling package supports disciplined screening, negotiation preparation, and internal investment communication.

## Tools Used

- Excel
- Financial statement analysis
- Scenario and sensitivity modeling techniques
